M2000 Interpreter and Environment

Version 10 revision 7 active-X
Additions to xmlData object. A new example Xml2 added. Now we can delete nodes, change attributes values. Using a list we can export children to stack object, and then we can feed a list object using a pair key/value, where value is the object pointer. We make the sort and we delete the childrens and fast we attach the trees as childs (by using the pointer only for each). In XmlData we not use pointers from child to parent.

The fist time you run the interpreter do this in M2000 console:
dir appdir$
load info
then press F1 to save info.gsb to M2000 user directory

Read wiki at Github for compiling M2000 from source.

From version 9.0 revision 50:
there is a new ca.crt - install ca.crt as root certificate (optional)
