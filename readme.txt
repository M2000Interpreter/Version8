M2000 Interpreter and Environment

Version 9.8 Revision 4 active-X

- Added Binary.Add() to perform addition modulo 2^32
- fix Def. In this example all variables are long except c which is boolean.
Previous d defined as boolean also. This isn't as designed.
Def long a,b, c as boolean, d
- fix meditor in Info.gsb (bundled in this setup), when we use control box in form, and choose the help menu item, an error occur. Now is ok (we just put a 0 as parameter. 

When fist time run the interpreter do this in M2000 console:
dir appdir$
load info
then press F1 to save info.gsb to M2000 user directory
