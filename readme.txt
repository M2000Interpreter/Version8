M2000 Interpreter and Environment

Version 10 revision 19 active-X
An Overflow error happen at the refresh control system - after 24.85 days. This normally never happen, if we start/stop computer each day. But for some unkown reason today Windows 10 start like they have 621 hours of continue running time. So I fix the M2000 Environment, but the problem exist for Windows 10.

The fist time you run the interpreter do this in M2000 console:
dir appdir$
load info
then press F1 to save info.gsb to M2000 user directory

Read wiki at Github for compiling M2000 from source.

From version 9.0 revision 50:
there is a new ca.crt - install ca.crt as root certificate (optional)
