M2000 Interpreter and Environment

Version 9.7 active-X

Tab character allowed in M2000 files.
We can set the tab width for tab character in edit:
edit! 4  ' set 4 characters
We can use tabs for indentation. Using swithes "-TAB" we can use spaces for indentation, or if a block of lines have a space as indentation, automatic indentation change to space for those lines.
For EditBox we can define the width for tabs.
Report statement (rendering text with justification in a layer) can use tabs too, but with 8 character width as standard.


From version 9.0 revision 50:
